Python New Zealand aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability, or religion to discuss and learn about all things Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement.

Python New Zealand organises and sponsors a diverse range of online and physical spaces including (but not limited to) the Python New Zealand mailing list, the Kiwi PyCon conference, our online chat channels, and local Python meetups. In order to achieve our goals, we encourage all participants to create a friendly, welcoming environment for everyone involved.

We expect participants to treat each other respectfully. Python New Zealand will not tolerate any intimidation, harassment, and/or any abusive, discriminatory behaviour by any participants. The use of inappropriate, derogatory, and/or offensive content/behaviour in any of these spaces is strictly prohibited. The Python New Zealand committee has the final decision on what is acceptable behaviour. A breach of conduct may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal from the Python New Zealand related events and spaces.

If you see or hear something that makes you uncomfortable, we encourage you to make a complaint. To make a complaint:

1. Contact the organisers of the event (if applicable), or the Python New Zealand committee confidentially via email to [committee@python.nz](mailto:committee@python.nz).
2. You may also contact any member of the [committee](https://python.nz/committee) individually if you prefer.

If you make a complaint, the Python New Zealand committee undertake to:

1. Keep your identity private, maintaining your anonymity.
2. Take your complaint seriously, investigate the incident, and take any action we deem necessary.
3. The committee may, at its discretion, publish a ‘transparency report’ to the Python New Zealand mailing list that includes the nature of the complaint and what the committee decided to do about it. These reports help us inform the community of the actions the committee have taken, and will be published unless there’s a good reason not to. In all cases, the offender and the complainant will be made anonymous in any such report.

Python New Zealand may take any or all of the following measures:

- The offender may be told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately and a warning will be issued.
- The offender may be asked to immediately leave the venue/space.
- The offender may be prohibited from continuing to attend any Python New Zealand-based events.
- The incident may be reported to New Zealand Police.

Python New Zealand is aware of the responsibility required to ensure a successful and productive community now and in years to come, and will take appropriate measures after an incident occurs to prevent it from happening again.
