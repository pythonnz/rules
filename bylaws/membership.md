# Membership (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 21 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

- Membership is for one year. The membership year is the financial year 01 January-31
  December.
- When a new member joins the Society, the initial annual membership fee is charged
  proportionally for the remainder of the year (e.g. halfway through the year you only
  pay half the fee).
- If a new member joins the Society in the month of December, the annual membership fee to
  be paid is for the following year, and the remaining proportional fee for the month of
  December is waived.
