# Term Limits (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 21 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

- At this time, there are no term limits.
- As actual positions within the committee are determined by the elected committe, we
  are considering the introduction of term limits for key positions: chairperson, deputy
  chairperson, treasurer, secretary.
- The goal of such term limits / rotations would be to distribute institutional
  knowledge and soften the dependence on any particular individual.
