# Term Limits (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 29 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

There are currently no term limits for committee members.

The committee is considering the introduction of term limits for key officer positions -
chairperson, deputy chairperson, treasurer, and secretary.

The purpose of such limits or rotations would be to:

- broaden the distribution of institutional knowledge, and
- reduce dependence on any single individual.
