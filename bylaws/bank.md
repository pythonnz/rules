# Bank (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 21 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

Further to the "Finances" section "40. Control and management" of our Constitution, this
document describes practical implementation details for day-to-day operations.

- The treasurer and secretary shall have joint required signing rights, and operate the
  bank accounts and make payments as needed.

- These signing rights shall be assigned by the newly elected committee at the time of
  the Annual General Meeting, and documented with a corresponding signed mandate that is
  suitable to present to the bank. The treasurer and secretary are to advise the bank of
  any mandate changes and revocation of previously assigned access.

- For the purpose of online credit/debit card payments – which require a bank account
  with a single signatory – a separate bank account is operated by the treasurer alone.
  This account shall only be used for the purpose of making specific payments via
  credit/debit card, and only receives the required funds from the jointly operated bank
  accounts when necessary.

- No member of the Society or any person associated with a member shall participate in
  or materially influence any decision made by the Society in respect of the payment to
  or on behalf of that member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage
  whatsoever. Any such income paid shall be reasonable and relative to that which would
  be paid in an arm's length transaction (being the open market value).
