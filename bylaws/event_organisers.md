# Event Organisers (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 29 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

The relationship between Python New Zealand and individual event organisers is described
by three documents:

- [Python New Zealand and Event Organisers](event_organisers.md) - outlines aspirations,
  expectations, responsibilities and commitments
- [Event Organiser Commitment](commmitment.md) - a form signed by event organisers to
  confirm their commitment
- [HOWTO Python New Zealand Events](howto_events.md) - describes "how we currently do
  things" - the framework organisers are expected to follow

**Note: These are currently in a separate repository while the initial versions are
being finalised between committee and current organisers.**
