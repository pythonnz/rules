# Event Organisers (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 21 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

The relationship between Python New Zealand and individual event organiser is described
by three documents:

- Goals / Relationship (motivations and spirit)
- Commitment (form to sign)
- Events HOWTO (living document guide)

These are currently in a separate repository as their initial version is being finalised
between committee and current organisers.
