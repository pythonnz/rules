# Activities (Bylaw)

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 21 Sep 2025<br> Status: Draft**

Copied verbatim from our previous constitution, where they were rules 2b, 2c and 2d.

## Meetups

- To support the Python community in the organisation of local Python networking events
  in their area, either through provision of software and, where possible, financially
  (e.g., food and drinks), or in other ways the Charity’s committee sees fit.

## Kiwi PyCon

The Charity aims to organise an annual conference (“Kiwi PyCon”). This means:

- The Charity pays for any costs associated with hosting the conference website
- The Charity committee appoints an organising committee for each conference
- The funds of the Charity may, at the Charity committee’s discretion, be used for the
  purposes of organising the conference
- Any profits from running the conference shall be retained by the Charity
- The Charity committee shall override decisions by the organising committee where it
  deems these to not adhere to the Charity’s charter

## Inclusivity

New Zealand Python User Group aims to foster an inclusive community which invites
diverse groups of people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race,
gender, gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability or religion to discuss and
learn about all things Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and
encouragement. Everyone has the right to feel safe and to be safe.
