Further to the "Introductory rules" section "4. Purposes" of the Society's Constitution,
this document describes practical implementation details.

## Meetups

- The Society will support the Python community in the organisation of local Python
  networking events in their area, either through provision of software and, where
  possible, financially (e.g., food and drinks), or in other ways the Society’s
  committee sees fit.

## Kiwi PyCon

The Society aims to organise an annual conference (“Kiwi PyCon”). This means:

- The Society pays for any costs associated with hosting the conference website.
- The Society's committee appoints an organising committee for each conference.
- The funds of the Society may, at the discrection of the Society's committee, be used
  for the purposes of organising the conference.
- Any profits from running the conference shall be retained by the Society.
- The Society's committee shall override decisions by the organising committee where it
  deems these to not adhere to the Society's constitution.

## Inclusivity

Python New Zealand aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of
people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race, gender, gender identity
and expression, sexuality, disability or religion to discuss and learn about all things
Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement. Everyone has
the right to feel safe and to be safe.
