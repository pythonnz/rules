## Aspirations / Expectations / Responsibilities / Commitments

## As an Event Organiser

### I want to

- bring people together for Python-related events
- be recognised for my contributions to Python New Zealand’s mission

### I don’t want to

- “start from scratch” creating an identity, framework, rules, finding participants
- spend money

### I’m willing to commit to

- **spending time** organising events (e.g., finding speakers/content, chairing the
  events)
- ensuring the events follow **Python New Zealand’s spirit and mission**
- ensuring participants of the events follow **Python New Zealand’s Code of Conduct**

## As Python New Zealand

### We want to

- support people organising Python events
- ensure that events in the charity’s name and under its banner follow the charity’s
  spirit, mission, and Code of Conduct

### We don’t want to

- support events that do not follow the charity’s spirit, mission, or Code of Conduct
- support event organisers who are in breach of their commitments

### We are willing to commit to

- providing a framework and template for running events, including a **branded presence
  on meetup.com** with a co-organiser account able to create and edit events
- enforcing the Python New Zealand **code of conduct** and act on any breaches reported
  on by an event organiser (or anyone else)
- assisting event organisers in their **marketing efforts** with exposure on
  - other meetup groups owned by Python New Zealand
  - the Python New Zealand website [https://python.nz/news](https://python.nz/news)

  - Python New Zealand social media accounts where required: Bluesky, Facebook,
    LinkedIn, Mastodon
  - the Python New Zealand (“NZPUG”) mailing list
- assisting event organisers with a **communication channel** on our Discord chat
  server, available for coordinating event organisation and communication with
  members/participants (e.g., #meetup-yourcity)
- assisting event organisers with **branded material** used in running events (e.g.,
  laminated posters for various purposes at the venue)
- assisting event organisers in the search for **venues and catering**, e.g.,
  approaching potential sponsors as a registered charity rather than a private
  individual
- assisting event organisers by holding a **regular organisers meeting** online across
  all event organisers for the purpose of exchanging experiences and coordinating joint
  efforts and overlaps
- assisting event organisers directly with **timely responses to enquiries** and
  suggestions sent to [committee@python.nz](mailto:committee@python.nz) by event
  organisers
- being open to considering **any other type of support** that organisers may request
- **recognising event organisers** and their efforts officially: on the Python New
  Zealand website, in newsletters and blog posts, at the Annual General Meeting.
