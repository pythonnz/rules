# Python New Zealand - Event Organiser Commitment

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 11 Nov 2025<br> Status: Active**

As an organiser of one or more events under the banner of Python New Zealand, I
understand that I am representing the charity. I commit to the following:

1. I will ensure these events align with the spirit and mission of Python New Zealand,
   as outlined in section "4. Purposes" of the Society’s Constitution (see Appendix A).
2. I will ensure that all participants adhere to Python New Zealand’s Code of Conduct
   (see Appendix B), and I will report any breaches to the committee.
3. I will use the Python New Zealand name and logo only as provided, and in accordance
   with any branding guidelines.
4. If I promote non-Python New Zealand events via Python New Zealand platforms or
   channels, I will clearly indicate that they are not affiliated with Python New
   Zealand.
5. I understand that my access to Python New Zealand platforms and tools may be revoked
   if I breach this commitment. Final decisions rest with the Python New Zealand
   committee.

## Appendix B

### Code of Conduct

_From
[https://python.nz/about/code-of-conduct/](https://python.nz/about/code-of-conduct/)_

Python New Zealand aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of
people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race, gender, gender identity
and expression, sexuality, disability, or religion to discuss and learn about all things
Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement.

Python New Zealand organises and sponsors a diverse range of online and physical spaces
including (but not limited to) the Python New Zealand mailing list, the Kiwi PyCon
conference, our online chat channels, and local Python meetups. In order to achieve our
goals, we encourage all participants to create a friendly, welcoming environment for
everyone involved.

We expect participants to treat each other respectfully. Python New Zealand will not
tolerate any intimidation, harassment, and/or any abusive, discriminatory behaviour by
any participants. The use of inappropriate, derogatory, and/or offensive
content/behaviour in any of these spaces is strictly prohibited. The Python New Zealand
committee has the final decision on what is acceptable behaviour. A breach of conduct
may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal from the Python New
Zealand related events and spaces.

If you see or hear something that makes you uncomfortable, we encourage you to make a
complaint. To make a complaint:

1. Contact the organisers of the event (if applicable), or members of the Python New
   Zealand committee [committee@python.nz](mailto:committee@python.nz).
2. You may also contact any member of the committee individually if you prefer.

If you make a complaint, the Python New Zealand committee undertake to:

1. Keep your identity private, maintaining your anonymity.
2. Take your complaint seriously, investigate the incident, and take any action we deem
   necessary.
3. The committee may, at its discretion, publish a ‘transparency report’ to the Python
   New Zealand mailing list that includes the nature of the complaint and what the
   committee decided to do about it. These reports help us inform the community of the
   actions the committee have taken, and will be published unless there’s a good reason
   not to. In all cases, the offender and the complainant will be made anonymous in any
   such report.

Python New Zealand may take any or all of the following measures:

- The offender may be told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately and a warning
  will be issued.
- The offender may be asked to immediately leave the venue/space.
- The offender may be prohibited from continuing to attend any Python New Zealand-based
  events.
- The incident may be reported to New Zealand Police.

Python New Zealand is aware of the responsibility required to ensure a successful and
productive community now and in years to come, and will take appropriate measures after
an incident occurs to prevent it from happening again.
