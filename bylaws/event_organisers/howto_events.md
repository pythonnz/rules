# HOWTO Python New Zealand Events

**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 11 Nov 2025<br> Status: Active**

This document describes "how we currently do things".<br> Rather than a prescriptive
rulebook it is meant to be a useful reference, esp. for new organisers.

This is a living document. It may be incomplete and/or inaccurate. The tools we use may
change. How we do things evolves.

**Any changes to this document will continue to reflect the expectations and commitments
outlined in
["Python New Zealand and Event Organisers"](https://github.com/pythonnz/event-organisers/blob/main/PythonNZ/event_organisers.md).**

## Monthly Meetups

### Other Organisers

- All meetup organisers are added to the mailing list meetup-organisers@python.nz

- We aim to meet monthly via videoconference, for a general catchup and exchange of
  experiences, and to discuss matters concerning all organisers.

### Organising - meetup.com

- We use [meetup.com](https://meetup.com/) and event organisers need to join their group
  and then get account permissions that allow them to create and edit events.

- We currently have 4 groups: [Auckland](https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-auckland/),
  [Wellington](https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-wellington/),
  [Christchurch](https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-christchurch/) and
  [Online Events](https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-online/).

- Monthly Meetup Report<br> Event organisers fill out
  [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/187tNDu20tf-vZf-hPrip3S6muMFjqYNTBebSDf16Jck/edit)
  after each event, to help us keep track of statistics (for the annual report to
  Charities Services and for ourselves).

### Chat

- The Python New Zealand
  [Discord server](<(https://python.nz/get-involved/chat-with-the-community/)>) has a
  channel for meetups. It is not meant for general discussions (which should happen in
  `#general`), but rather to coordinate meetups, e.g. last minute announcements, pickups
  from venue door, discussion of a specific talk.

### Video conferencing

- There are currently two options being used for running video conferences: Big Blue
  Button or Google Meet. The important requirements for a video conferencing platform
  are a) it works for all participants b) it doesn't require participants to register an
  account.

- Please note that a regular Gmail account will have a 1h limit on video conferences.
  Event organisers can get a firstname.lastname@python.nz (Google Workspace) account
  which does not have this limitation.

### Video recordings

- When video recordings are to be published (with consent of the recorded parties), we
  add short intro/outro slides to the video and then upload them to the Python New
  Zealand [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@PythonNewZealand).

### Advertising

- We start all news items by creating a blog post on https://python.nz/news/ which then
  gets disseminated through appropriate channels such as
  [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nzpug),
  [Discord](https://python.nz/get-involved/chat-with-the-community/),
  [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/python.nz),
  [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pythonnz),
  [Facebook](https://facebook.com/pythonnz),
  [LinkedIn](https://nz.linkedin.com/company/pythonnz) and
  [Meetup](https://python.nz/get-involved/meet-others/) group announcements. Event
  organisers sign up to the [python.nz](https://python.nz) Wordpress site and can then
  create blog posts that are then reviewed and published. The PythonNZ committee is
  notified when someone creates a blog post to be reviewed, and the author is notified
  when it is published.
