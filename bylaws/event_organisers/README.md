**Python New Zealand<br> Last update: 15 Dec 2025<br> Status: Active**

The relationship between Python New Zealand and individual event organisers is described
by three documents:

- [Python New Zealand and Event Organisers](event_organisers.md) - outlines aspirations,
  expectations, responsibilities and commitments
- [Event Organiser Commitment](commitment.md) - a form signed by event organisers to
  confirm their commitment
- [HOWTO Python New Zealand Events](howto_events.md) - describes "how we currently do
  things"
