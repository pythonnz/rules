# Still to be agreed by entire committee

- [ ] 6.2 Borrowing via GM retained
- [ ] 33.2/33.3 term limits (and when the counting starts)
- [ ] 37.6 Right to be forgotten (new)

# Questions for lawyer

- [ ] 15.1.(iv)(b) "In the opinion of the Committee the Member has brought the Society
      into disrepute." - listed separately from a dispute resolution result 15.1.(ii)
      and thus bypassing it? What would be a practical situation where this is
      justifiably used?
- [ ] 34.1.(ii) Similarly, "in the opinion of the Committee or the Society" this
      determination of disrepute seems to bypass the dispute resolution process? What
      would be a practical situation where this is justifiably used?
- [ ] Further to the above two clauses, there is 17.2. distinguishing between a
      "disciplinary" and a dispute resolution process. Wondering if a GM is required to
      re-admit a former Member, maybe it should only be a GM that can perform a
      "disciplinary process" - or is that impractical?
- [ ] 42.3.(iv) "or Member's rights or interests generally have been damaged" - does
      this not open us up to disputes that are unrelated to the society (other than the
      parties are members)? Potentially leading to mediation costs covered by the
      society? (based on a true story)
- [ ] 11.1, 12.1, 12.3, 15.1.(i) We are wondering whether the submission of online forms
      and sending of emails covers the requirement "in writing"?
- [ ] 37.6 I hope our intent is clear. Is this suitable wording for a "Right to be
      forgotten" clause?
- [ ] 13.1 and 37.2(iii)(b) - we do not want to force people to provide their phone
      number - name and email address is sufficient for us. So we would like to strike
      this requirement to collect and store the phone number as part of the member's
      contact details. Is there a legal requirement to keep it, or can we just adjust
      13.1 to "optionally a phone number" and strike 37.2(iii)(b) to "a phone number, if
      provided" ?
- [ ] 6.2 "(if any)â€”" - Can we just delete this - looks like a superfluous leftover from
      the constitution builder?

Please note - we intend to put some "implementation details" into bylaws:

- Membership runs with the financial year 01 Jan-31 Dec, the initial fee is
  proportionate (e.g. joining in October)
- Very specific bank account and VISA card setup, dual signatories and bank mandate
  change process (the treasurer is not mentioned in 40.)
- Guidelines and commitment forms for event organisers
- Code of Conduct
- Activities - what we actually do in pursuit of our purposes listed in 4.1
- Reporting/Transparency - what information is published where (e.g. AGM minutes)
