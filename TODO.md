# Still to be agreed by entire committee

- [x] 6.2 Borrowing via GM retained<br> **-> yes, retained**
- [x] 33.2/33.3 term limits (and when the counting starts)<br> **-> remove, possibly
      introduce as bylaw**
- [x] 37.6 Right to be forgotten (new)<br> **-> yes, add, pending lawyer's confirmation
      of wording**
- [ ] 32.1.(i) "Any such appointment must be ratified at the next Annual General
      Meeting." Given that we have 1 year terms that seems pointless - remove?

# Questions for lawyer

- [x] 15.1.(iv)(b) "In the opinion of the Committee the Member has brought the Society
      into disrepute." - listed separately from a dispute resolution result 15.1.(ii)
      and thus bypassing it? What would be a practical situation where this is
      justifiably used?<br> -> **Clause 15.1.(iv)(b) uses the concept of a Member
      bringing the Society into “disrepute”. The inconsistency with a person expelled
      under a dispute procedure is inherent in the MBIE Constitution Builder where the
      “disrepute” provision is selected as an additional provision. An example is a
      member having a social media account which refers to the Society while posting
      statements that are defamatory or racist.**
- [x] 34.1.(ii) Similarly, "in the opinion of the Committee or the Society" this
      determination of disrepute seems to bypass the dispute resolution process? What
      would be a practical situation where this is justifiably used?<br> **Clause
      34.1(ii) is similar and relates to an Officer. Again, there is an inconsistency,
      and it would be prudent for both provisions to be amended to clarify that the
      dispute procedures can be invoked by an Officer or Member where the Committee
      proposes to pass a resolution about “disrepute”.**
- [x] Further to the above two clauses, there is 17.2. distinguishing between a
      "disciplinary" and a dispute resolution process. Wondering if a GM is required to
      re-admit a former Member, maybe it should only be a GM that can perform a
      "disciplinary process" - or is that impractical?<br> **--> see above**
- [x] 42.3.(iv) "or Member's rights or interests generally have been damaged" - does
      this not open us up to disputes that are unrelated to the society (other than the
      parties are members)? Potentially leading to mediation costs covered by the
      society? (based on a true story)<br> **->Clause 42.3(iv) has a clear meaning if
      the MBIE language is used being “a Member's rights or interests as a Member”, but
      the first apostrophe has been omitted from your draft Constitution. I recommend
      reinstating the apostrophe.**
- [x] 11.1, 12.1, 12.3, 15.1.(i) We are wondering whether the submission of online forms
      and sending of emails covers the requirement "in writing"?<br> **-> In my view,
      the submission of online forms and sending of emails satisfies the "in writing"
      requirement.**
- [x] 37.6 I hope our intent is clear. Is this suitable wording for a "Right to be
      forgotten" clause?<br> **-> I think that the wording is suitable, although it
      could be amended to permit retention for say 12 months, rather than refer to the
      financial year of the Society. <br> [...] <br> I note that it could make the
      operation of section 17 (applications by former members) difficult.**
- [x] 13.1 and 37.2(iii)(b) - we do not want to force people to provide their phone
      number - name and email address is sufficient for us. So we would like to strike
      this requirement to collect and store the phone number as part of the member's
      contact details. Is there a legal requirement to keep it, or can we just adjust
      13.1 to "optionally a phone number" and strike 37.2(iii)(b) to "a phone number, if
      provided" ?<br> **-> I regret to advise that this a legislative requirement and
      applies in relation to both Members and Contact Persons, but not Officers. Section
      5(2)**
- [x] 6.2 "(if any)—" - Can we just delete this - looks like a superfluous leftover from
      the constitution builder?<br> **-> I agree that the words “(if any)” in Clause 6.2
      ought to be deleted.**
- [x] COMMENT BY LAWYER: "Clause 32 relates to election of officers and in clause
      32.1(i) requires appointments of Officers made between AGMs by the Committee to be
      ratified. This adopts the MBIE Constitution Builder language, although I am not
      sure what is the effect of an AGM not ratifying the appointment. Where there are
      Officer terms of more than 1 year, ratification or election at the next AGM makes
      sense, but in my view not otherwise (as in the present instance where Clause 33.1
      provides for appointments for 1 year to the next AGM)."<br> **-> committee to
      confirm removal (see above)**
- [x] CONFIRMED BY LAWYER: 2.1 can just read "The **Society** is registered as a
      charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005." - there is no timing issue with
      re-registration so we don't need "or intends after incorporation" which could make
      readers wonder whether we actually are registered as a charity.
